      <div className="contentBody">Autists directly link their experiences of socio-spatial exclusion to
        neurophysiological sensitivities and differences (Davidson, 2010). The increasing prevalence of autism and its
        depictions in media has raised this clinical category to the level of a social and cultural phenomenon. Yet,
        neither the economic calculations of its global burden (Baxter et al., 2014), nor its place of prominence “in
        ongoing social science and humanities debates about intersubjectivity, intentionality, empathy, and the social
        construction of disability” (Solomon, 2010: 242) address the very real personal and actual cost of
        misunderstanding and stigmatization of autists and their families (Kinnear et al., 2016).

      <div className="contentBody">Biomusic, by enabling others to “tune in” to meaningful changes in an individual’s
        physiological state, has been shown to increase the sense of presence and personhood of persons who have
        diverse communicative capacities (Blain-Moraes et al., 2013). Thus, biomusic has profound implications for
        persons on the neurological spectrum, as it pushes the boundaries circumscribing subjectivity by offering a
        potential new mode of becoming aware of others’ sensitivities, counteracting (often misread) culturally
        informed ways of interpreting another’s expressions and actions (Kirmayer and Ramstead, Forthcoming), and
        thus, potentially supporting more inclusive ways of interacting with others. However, providing uninvited
        insight into an individual’s electrophysiological states has the equal potentiality of being misused and
        abused, which raises a number of overlapping <span className="contentBodyEm">everyday ethical, aesthetic and practical concerns</span>
        that must be addressed before it can be meaningfully integrated into everyday life. <span
          className="contentBodyIt">Everyday ethics</span>, an
        emerging field of philosophical inquiry in fields ranging from ethnographic, first- person anthropology
        (Mattingly, 2012;
        Mattingly, 2014; Lambek, 2015; Keane, 2015) to neuroscience (Zizzo et al., 2016) and philosophy (Massumi, 2002)
        shifts attention to how contemplations of the best good, that guide our actions, emerges in our everyday
        interactions with other. Since biomusic “reveals” otherwise tacit embodied expressions, the everyday ethical
        concerns pertain, amongst other things, to potential transgressions of the boundaries of privacy and power
        (Sterne, 2012) and misreading or imposition of meaning during the process of translating (Latour, 1999)
        physiological signals to emotional states. How do we decide what is the best good for a range of particular
        situations with unique personal experiences? The aesthetic concerns pertain to the history of cultural
        representations of disability at large and of autism in particular, in which individuals identified as
        “others” to the norm are held to be representative of atypical traits rather than unique sensibilities
        (Gilman, 2014; Prince, 2010; Gilman, 1988; Gilman, 1985; Prince-Hughes, 2013). To what extent might biomusic
        have the potential to fall in a similar trap, as the aestheticized (musical) expression of non-neurotypical
        physiological responses? Finally, the practical concerns we wish to address concern the design, implementation
        and use of biomusic as a communication technology across diverse neurological experiences, and its potential
        furthering of the stigmatization of persons with invisible disabilities.

      <div className="contentBody">The sequence of events and selection of locations over the three-day event embody
        the values of integrated knowledge mobilization. We will explore: (1) the capacities and challenges facing
        initiatives to create autism-friendly cities led by citizen stakeholders in a public venue; (2) the background
        and potentialities of physiological signal analysis, followed by a multi-sensory experience of translating
        physiological signals into biomusic in cultural institutions for the sciences and the arts; and (3) an open
        roundtable discussion on the potentialities, including everyday ethical challenges of using biotechnology to
        ameliorate inclusion in an interinstitutional research center.
